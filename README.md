# collection of div surrogates

A piece of web art by Michael Kolesidis.

It makes use of the [DOM Window Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dom-window-manager), a tiny library created by me.

Inspired by the work _[Collection of Forty Plaster Surrogates](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/79653)_ (1982) by [Allan McCollum](http://allanmccollum.net/allanmcnyc/)
